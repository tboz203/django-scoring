# Notes

### 2015-03-14
okay, we've got the model layer down.

- Manager: name, phone number
- Locations: location
- Team: name, [manager], school
- Team Challenge: name
- TC fields: name, type, [team challenge]
- TC appraisers: name, [team challenge]
- TC event: time, [team], [team challenge], [location]
- TC scores: value, [TC field], [TC appraiser], [TC event]
- IC appraisers: name
- IC event: time, [team], [location]
- IC scores: value, [IC event], [IC appraiser]

- TC appraiser permissions: [TC appraiser], [TC fields]

> // roles?
> // need to work out the specifics of how a role would work

The pieces that are left are the templates, the views, and the `urlconf`.
We *could* start working on the templates, but I think we need to work out
what the views should be, and how they should interact and such.

In the original app, the main screen was a list of teams grouped by ...
Dangit. I forgot the classifications

- Team: name, [manager], school, classification ((E)lementary, (M)iddle, (H)igh, (U)niversity, (O)ther)

I think there's like "project outreach", and possibly something else. We'll
check it later and correct.

Back to the views: the main screen was a list of teams grouped by
classification. Then there was a list of all teams. There were lists for the
TC/IC appraisers, but those should be admin-side.

There will be a page for inputting scores for each event. I'm thinking a page
for all scores related to an event (shows all appraisers input), and then
individual pages per appraiser. There should be a page that summarizes all of
the team's info going in (i.e.: not scores), and then pages summarizing their
scores. We could do pages for managers to keep up-to-date on their team(s), and
pages for the general public wanting to see performances. 

... We should probably narrow down what we want to start with, and do that.
Let's do the list of all teams, and the event detail page.

The urls will look something like this:
    /scoring/                         -> the all-teams list
    /scoring/<team>/                  -> the info detail
    /scoring/<team>/scores/           -> the scores detail
    /scoring/<team>/team-challenge    -> the `tc_event` detail
    /scoring/team-challenges          -> the `tc_event` list
    etc...

reading through documentation on writing views. spent 3 hours playing with
admin site, 2 of which were setting the list views to display all columns
